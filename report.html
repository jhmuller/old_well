<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >This document gives a brief summary of the analysis of the data on large positions in
Japanese securities for 5 asset managers.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   While the end goal of our work is a realistic trading strategy, this analysis focused
on the question of whether there is information in the trades or holdings
of these asset managers. To answer that question we can imagine creating
<span 
class="cmti-10">signals </span>from the data. While many signals could be created we focused on the
following:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Entering into a position of over 5
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Increasing an already large holdings (i.e. already over 5
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Decreasing an already large holdings (i.e. already over 5
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Exiting the large position, i.e. lowering holdings to less than 5</li></ul>
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   In evaluating these signals we would like to know if the subsequent returns of the
security outperformed some benchmark. We might be interested in comparing to a
number of benchmarks of interest to investors including:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">a passive index, e.g. Nikkei,
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">short term treasuries,
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">a basket of peer securities,
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">past performance of the same security over the same timeframe.</li></ul>
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   I choose the last since it was the most readily available in the data set.
